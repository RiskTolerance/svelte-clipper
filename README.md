# svelte-clipper

Responsive, reactive SVG clip paths for Svelte 5. Define a clip shape anywhere in the DOM, apply it to anything anywhere else — across independent coordinate spaces, transforms, scroll containers, and CSS animations. Compose multiple shapes together with real boolean operations (union, difference, intersection, …).

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
 import { Clipper, ClippedBy } from 'svelte-clipper';
</script>

<Clipper id="hole">
 <svg viewBox="0 0 100 100"><circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" /></svg>
</Clipper>

<ClippedBy clipper="hole">
 <img src="/cat.jpg" />
</ClippedBy>
```

## Installation

```sh
npm install dynamicbool
```

Svelte 5 is a peer dependency.

## Why

`clip-path: url(#id)` works, but the clip shape has to live in a coordinate system the target understands. The moment the shape and target have different transforms, sit in different scroll containers, scale differently, or animate independently, the math gets painful fast. `svelte-clipper` watches both sides and continuously re-projects the shape into the target's local space, so you can put the clipper anywhere and the target anywhere and they just line up.

## Core components

### `<Clipper>`

Wraps the element(s) that define the clip shape. The shape can be any SVG graphics element (`path`, `circle`, `ellipse`, `rect`, `polygon`, `polyline`) or a container (`svg`, `g`) with any number of nested shapes.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
 import { Clipper } from 'svelte-clipper';
</script>

<Clipper id="my-shape" preview live>
 <svg viewBox="0 0 200 200">
  <polygon points="100,10 40,198 190,78 10,78 160,198" />
 </svg>
</Clipper>
```

#### Clipper props

| Prop       | Type      | Default | Description                                                                                                                              |
| ---------- | --------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`       | `string`  | —       | Identifier that `ClippedBy` uses to find this shape.                                                                                     |
| `preview`  | `boolean` | `false` | Renders the shape with a dashed outline so you can see what's being used as the clipper. Otherwise the shape itself is invisible.        |
| `live`     | `boolean` | `false` | Polls the shape's screen transform every animation frame. Turn on when the shape (or an ancestor) moves via CSS animation / transitions. |
| `children` | Snippet   | —       | The SVG content.                                                                                                                         |

### `<ClippedBy>`

Wraps the content that should be clipped. Accepts any HTML or SVG — images, divs, entire components.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
 import { ClippedBy } from 'svelte-clipper';
</script>

<ClippedBy clipper="my-shape" mode="clip">
 <div class="content">anything in here</div>
</ClippedBy>
```

#### ClippedBy props

| Prop       | Type                   | Default    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `clipper`  | `string \| string[]`   | —          | One clipper id, or an array to combine several into a single clip.                                                                                                                                                          |
| `mode`     | `'clip' \| 'subtract'` | `'clip'`   | `'clip'` keeps only what's inside the shape. `'subtract'` keeps everything _except_ the shape (punches a hole).                                                                                                             |
| `combine`  | `CombineOp`            | `'concat'` | How to fuse multiple clippers. `'concat'` just appends them (with even-odd fill). The others run a real boolean op via `path-bool`: `'union'`, `'difference'`, `'intersection'`, `'exclusion'`, `'division'`, `'fracture'`. |
| `class`    | `string`               | —          | Forwarded to the wrapper `<div>`. Use this to size the clipping region.                                                                                                                                                     |
| `children` | Snippet                | —          | The content to clip.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Examples

### Multiple shapes as one clip

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
 import { Clipper, ClippedBy } from 'svelte-clipper';
</script>

<Clipper id="circle-a"><svg viewBox="0 0 100 100"><circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" /></svg></Clipper>
<Clipper id="circle-b"><svg viewBox="0 0 100 100"><circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" /></svg></Clipper>

<ClippedBy clipper={['circle-a', 'circle-b']} combine="union" mode="subtract">
 <img src="/photo.jpg" />
</ClippedBy>
```

Two independent SVGs — possibly in very different parts of the page — combined into one hole.

### CSS-animated clipper

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
 import { Clipper } from 'svelte-clipper';
</script>

<div class="spinner">
 <Clipper id="star" live>
  <svg viewBox="0 0 200 200"><polygon points="..." /></svg>
 </Clipper>
</div>

<style>
 .spinner {
  animation: spin 6s linear infinite;
 }
 @keyframes spin {
  to {
   transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
 }
</style>
```

`live` polls each frame so the clip tracks the CSS transform. Without it, mutations to the shape itself are still observed, but ancestor CSS animations are not.

### Complex, multi-path SVGs

The `<Clipper>` can wrap an entire `<svg>` containing nested `<g>` elements and many paths — all are combined into the clip shape, including multi-subpath paths with holes (via even-odd fill rule).

## Boolean operations

When passing an array of clippers, `combine` controls how the paths are fused before the final clip is applied. This is powered by [`path-bool`](https://r-flash.github.io/PathBool.js/).

| Op             | Meaning                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `concat`       | Append paths (default, fast). |
| `union`        | A ∪ B (merge overlaps).       |
| `difference`   | A − B.                        |
| `intersection` | A ∩ B.                        |
| `exclusion`    | A XOR B.                      |
| `division`     | Slice A using B's boundaries. |
| `fracture`     | Emit every partition.         |

Operations are folded left-to-right for more than two clippers.

## How it works

Under the hood, each `ClippedBy` renders a hidden `<svg><clipPath>` and applies it via `clip-path: url(#...)`. On every layout change (resize, scroll, mutation) or animation frame (in `live` mode), the library:

1. Reads the clipper's current screen-space CTM.
2. Reads the target's bounding rect.
3. Composes them into a source → target matrix.
4. Projects the shape's geometry through that matrix into a `d` string.
5. Optionally runs a boolean operation against other clippers.
6. Writes the result to the `<clipPath>`'s `<path>`.

Per-frame updates short-circuit when the composed matrix hasn't changed (e.g. during pure scroll where source and target move together), so the cost is effectively zero when nothing has actually shifted.

## Advanced exports

The registry and projection helpers are exported for custom integrations:

```ts
import {
 registerClipper,
 unregisterClipper,
 getClipperEl,
 subscribeClipper,
 notifyClipper,
 shapeToPath,
 SUPPORTED_SHAPE_TAGS,
 observeLayout
} from 'svelte-clipper';
```
